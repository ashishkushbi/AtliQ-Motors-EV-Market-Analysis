# Recommendations and Suggentions -

1. Who should be the brand ambassador if AtliQ Motors launches their EV/Hybrid vehicles in India and why? 

**Ram Charan will be the Best Brand Ambassador for an EV Company**.

   1. Massive popularity & Fresh Appeal
   2. Trustworthy and Clean Image
   3. Pan-India Reach
   4. Youth and Tech-Savvy Appeal
   5. Untapped Potential

2. Which state of India is ideal to start the manufacturing unit? (Based on subsidies provided, ease of doing business, stability in governance etc.)

**Gujarat is the best state to have a manufacturing plant in ease of govt support and Import & Export facilities**

Gujarat is rapidly becoming a key hub for EV manufacturing, attracting major investments from both new and established carmakers. Gujarat will be the best for manufacturing by its promising govt incentives and tax relief for both customer and makers. Also giant companies in India's like TATA, MARUTI SUZUKI invested in crores to extend the plants and open new ev manufacturing unit.

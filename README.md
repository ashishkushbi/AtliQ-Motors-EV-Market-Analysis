EV Sales and Market Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) sales and market trends using Power BI. The analysis covers multiple fiscal years and provides insights into the growth and market penetration of EVs compared to biofuel vehicles.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive view of the EV sales trend over recent fiscal years and to evaluate the market share of EVs in the overall vehicle sales landscape. By using Power BI, the analysis aims to highlight key metrics such as total sales, year-over-year growth, and the comparison of EV sales with biofuel vehicles.

Key Features of the Analysis
Data Sources: The dataset includes sales data for EVs and biofuel vehicles, spanning fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024.

Metrics:

Total Sales: Calculated for each year, showing the revenue and volume of EVs sold.
Year-Over-Year Growth: Comparison of sales growth between consecutive fiscal years.
EV Market Share: The percentage of EV sales in relation to total biofuel vehicle sales.
Revenue Analysis:

Average Sales: The average sales values calculated at 2 billion, 85 lakhs, and 50 lakhs out of a total of 4 billion.
Units Sold: Represented in terms of thousands ("K") for better readability.
Visualization: Multiple Power BI visuals were used, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, to represent data dynamically across selected fiscal years.

Dynamic Data Filtering: The dashboard allows users to filter data by fiscal year, dynamically adjusting the visualizations to show trends for specific time periods.

Tools Used
Power BI: For data modeling, visualization, and analysis.
Excel/CSV: Data input files containing sales information.
Insights and Findings
Growth of EV Sales: Significant growth was observed in EV sales over the three fiscal years.
EV Market Penetration: EVs are steadily increasing their share in the market, though biofuel vehicles still maintain a larger overall sales volume.
Revenue Trends: Revenue has shown consistent growth, with total sales averaging in the billions.
Future Scope
Further analyses could be performed to:

Examine geographic trends in EV sales.
Analyze consumer preferences based on demographics.
Predict future EV market trends based on current data.
